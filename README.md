# Sprite Mapper

Free software used to create normal maps for sprites.  
Normal map creation is based on function layers, which combine images.  
The images derive normal information for example from 2D drawings and 3D meshes.

Started as a project for Summer Studies course in Kajaani University of Applied Sciences.  
For now will remain unupdated, but I may return to work on this project again in the future.

## Planned Features

- [ ] 2D drawable images
- [ ] 3D mesh images
- [ ] Code images
- [ ] Context based actions with undo history
